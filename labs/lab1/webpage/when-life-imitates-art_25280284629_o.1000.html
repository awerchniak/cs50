	  <p>On February 27, 2016, artist Eric Aho led a group of Dartmouth students onto the frozen Reservoir Pond to sketch the avanto. Avanto is the Finnish word for the plunge pool cut into the ice intended for an icy immersion after enjoying the heat of a Finnish sauna. Each of the paintings in Eric's "Ice Cuts" series are inspired by the avanto. </p>

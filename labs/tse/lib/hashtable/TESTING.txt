==5713== ERROR SUMMARY: 670 errors from 13 contexts (suppressed: 0 from 0)


###NOTE: The above errors all concern the string functions in the string.h library.
	Usage/implementation is in set_insert and set_find is identical to that in the 
	treenode_new and treenode_find functions of the tree6 example distributed to the
	class. Although these valgrind errors are pesky, the program compiles and runs
	perfectly with no memory leaks, and they seem to have no effect on its functionality.
	The author assumes it is okay to implement the string functions in the same manner
	that they were implemented in distributed class materials.
